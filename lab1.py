# 1. Write a function that takes an integer and returns True if it is even. A way to figure out if
# an integer is even or odd is to divide the number by 2 and compute the remainder. If there
# is a remainder then it is an odd number, otherwise it is even. Use the following numbers to
# test your code: 5 and 122.
def isEven(number: int) -> bool: 
    return number % 2 == 0
print(isEven(5))
print(isEven(122))

# 2. In a module, there is a coursework and a quiz. The contribution from each element is configurable as a percentage, e.g. x% contribution from coursework and y% contribution from
# the quiz, where x + y = 100. With x and y, we create an array p = (x, y). Consider that
# someone achieves c marks for the coursework, and q marks for the quiz; all these marks are
# out of 100. So, the marks array is: m = (c, q). Write a function that takes the arrays p and
# m, and returns the overall percentage of marks achieved for a student.
def getMark(p: array, m: array) -> float:
    if len(p) != len(m):
        raise Exception("Sorry, array size do not match")

        mark += element * m[index]
    return mark
print(getMark([0.5, 0.4, 0.1], [49, 40, 100]))

# 3. Write a function that can return the maximum number in a list of integers using only
# for loop and comparison operators. Use the following numpy array to test your function:
# (1, 19, 2, 3, 4, 100); your program should return 100
def getMaximum(numbers: array) -> int:
    maxNumber: int = float('-inf')
    for number in numbers:
        if number > maxNumber:
            maxNumber = number

# 4. Write a function that can produce an m Ã— n dimensional random integer uniformly. Here m
# and n should be user defined. [Hint: you may find the random.uniform function useful]

    return numpy.random.uniform(0, 1, (m, n))
